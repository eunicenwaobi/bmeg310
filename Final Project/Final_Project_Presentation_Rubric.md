|Evaluation|1 (Severely Lacking)|2|3|4|5 (Excellent)|
| *Organization:* |Important concepts are omitted, slide content does not support the discussion, speakers read exclusively from slides, uneven distribution of presentation time per member, time is well over the limit, little to no time is spent on an important section|Important concepts unclear or glossed over, speakers read exclusively from slides, most slides are overly complex or lacking in content, there is an uneven distribution of presentation time per member|Concepts are not adequately explained and the content becomes difficult to understand, multiple slides are overly complicated or lacking content, presentation is significantly over time time limit (>1 min)|Presentation  and sections are easy to understand but some concepts may be unclear or a slide may be overly complicated or difficult to follow, presentation is slightly over time limit|All sections are present and covered, slides are easy to follow, ideas and results are clearly explained, speakers are engaging, presentation is within time limit|
| *Visual Clarity:* |There is a distinct lack of figures to convey important results, figures are overly cluttered/complex or the presenters take no time to explain the figure contents, no visual aids are used to help explain difficult concepts|Major data/results which would benefit from visual presentation lack corresponding figures, presenters often skim over figures or do not explain adequately so that the audience can follow, visual aids for concepts are lacking|Major results are presented in figures but they are overly complex or the presenters have a difficult time explaining them or conveying their importance, or figures are good but very little time is spent reviewing them, or an important result is not adequately visually presented, visual aids are present but not helpful|Important/complex results are presented visually in figures but may be difficult to follow even with explanation, visual aids are present and help convey concepts|Important/complex results are presented visually in figures to help convey their importance, figures are easy to follow and are clearly explained by presenters, visual aids are very helpfully used to convey concepts effectively|
| *Completeness of Methods:* |Research question is irrelevant and the choice of investigative methods do not follow from the research question, important details are consistently ommitted, there is no obvious workflow, there is no explanation of why particular approaches were taken|Research question may be somewhat irrelevant, relevance of methods to research question is lacking, important details about the methods are lacking or glossed over, the workflow is present but not easy to follow, reasons for approaches taken are missing or unreasonable|Research question is relevant but may not be adequately explained, methods are mostly clear but have multiple details lacking, workflow is present and mostly easy to follow, choices made for investigation are not clear or do not make sense in terms of the research question|Research question is relevant and well-explained, methods are mostly clear with some details lacking, workflow is clear and coherent, some choices made for the methods are not explained or do not obviously follow from the research question|Research question is relevant and well-explained, methods used are clearly highlighted with appropriate detail, overall workflow is clear and coherent, choices made for methods are clearly explained and framed in terms of the research question|
| *Completeness of Results:* |Results, if present, are irrelevant to the research question, there is little relevant interpretation of results or limitations of the dataset/methods, no attempt to discuss the biological importance of results nor literature, there is no relevant discussion of challenges faced|Some important results are obviously not present or results are not relevant to the research question, an attempt to obtain results is evident but there is limited discussion of the challenges and limitations of the data and methods used, or a conclusion is proposed which does not follow from the results, no discussion is made regarding the relevance of the results to the research question, no attempt is made to link to biological explanations nor literature|Some previous results may be missing or decisions made due to results may not make sense, conclusion is formulated in terms of the research question but may not have adequate support from the results, if no conclusion was found the explanation of why this was the case may be lacking or important challenges faced are not adequately addressed, no attempt to link results to a biological factor is made or no attempt to compare results to literature is made|Results at each stage are mostly clear but may be inadequately explained at times, decisions taken in respons to results are explained, conclusion is present but may be questionable in light of the results, or if no conclusion as found an attempt was made to explain the results in terms of limitations of the data and methods but obvious points may be missed, an attempt to compare the results to biological factors and literature was made without adequate support|Results at each stage of analysis are clear, decisions taken in response to results are clearly explained, a conclusion is well formulated in terms of both the research question and the results, if no conclusion was found a strong attempt to explain the results in terms of limitations of the data and methods is made, a strong attempt to link the results to biological factors is made, a strong attempt to compare results to literature is made|
